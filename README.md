**Theme:** Balance Heaven/Hell

**Enemies:** Angels and Devils

**Time Period:** Medieval

**Character:** Holy OR dark knight

**Concept:** You are a knight of a small kingdom sent to conquer the surrounding 2 kingdoms. There is a dark and a holy kingdom. The player can specialize in dark or holy arts but if they go too far in one direction then you “lose” and your player joins the kingdom of their specialized art and your kingdom falls to the other. Each level will alternate between the kingdoms you fight and it is the players job to balance how much dark and light energy they use before succumbing to its power.

**Goal:** The goal is to bring balance to the world as by defeating the Angel that leads the holy kingdom and defeating the devil that leads the dark kingdom.

**Holy Kingdom:** The holy kingdom is run by an Angel that has created a utopian-like society however, no one is allowed to feel or speak freely and all their people are like mindless drones. The angel gives the people a perfect life but at the cost of their own free will.

**Dark Kingdom:** The dark kingdom is run by a devil that has created a dystopian-like society where everyone acts purely on their emotions. Robbing, murder and all crime run rampant in the kingdom. The nobles are corrupt and focus solely on money and taking advantage of others. These people have no order and drown in their own desires and free will. 

**Your kingdom:** The balance between both, crime exists but so does order. People have free will but laws that keep them from going too far. Although a small kingdom, the king, nobles and people of your kingdom fear the threats from the other 2 kingdoms and believe it is time for you, the heroic knight, to take them down and their corrupt practices.
